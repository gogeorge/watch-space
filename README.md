# Watch Space
See who is in space right now and where the ISS is located right now

Watch Space uses ajax to request information and display them on an html page.

The example shows how the watchSpace.js can be used to display the information neatly

NOTE: There is a CORS error so the map will not load on the broswers. You will have to allow your browser to run the "unsafe" scripts so   that it can work (on Safari there is nothing you can do, Apple does not give an option to allow unsafe scripts). This is not my. fault but rather the developer of open-notify who still uses http instead of https. I am not planning on solving this issue any time soon.

Special thanks to @reallinfo for designing the logo.
